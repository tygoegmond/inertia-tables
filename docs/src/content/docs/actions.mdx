Actions in Inertia Tables provide interactive functionality that allows users to perform operations on table data. The action system supports three types of actions:

1. **Row Actions** - Actions that operate on individual table rows
2. **Bulk Actions** - Actions that operate on multiple selected rows

## Row Actions

Row actions are interactive buttons that appear for each row in your table, allowing users to perform operations on individual records.

```php
use Egmond\InertiaTables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->actions([
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

Actions may be created using the static `make()` method, passing its unique name.

You can then pass a function to `action()` which executes the task, or a function to `url()` which creates a link:

```php
use App\Models\Post;
use Egmond\InertiaTables\Actions\Action;

Action::make('edit')
    ->url(fn (Post $record): string => route('posts.edit', $record))
    ->openUrlInNewTab()

Action::make('delete')
    ->requiresConfirmation()
    ->action(fn (Post $record) => $record->delete())
```

All methods on the action accept callback functions, where you can access the current table `$record` that was clicked.

## Bulk actions

Tables also support "bulk actions". These actions operate on multiple selected rows and appear when rows are selected.

```php
use Egmond\InertiaTables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->bulkActions([
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

Bulk actions may be created using the static `make()` method, passing its unique name. You should then pass a callback to `action()` which executes the task:

```php
use Egmond\InertiaTables\Actions\BulkAction;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Collection;

BulkAction::make('delete')
    ->requiresConfirmation()
    ->action(fn (Collection $records) => $records->each->delete())
```

The function allows you to access the current table `$records` that are selected. It is an Eloquent collection of models.
